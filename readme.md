## README

A RabbitMQ worker queues **PLAYGROUND**.

#### Get up and running
1) clone this repository

2) in the root directory first run <code>npm install</code> and then <code>node install.js</code>

3) run <code>docker-compose up</code> in the root directory and then wait for everything to start up before moving on. You could just move on right away - but then nothing will work and we will all be sad.  

4) navigate to the root directory in another terminal window and run <code>node exercise.js</code> (requires **node.js v4.4.4 or newer**)


**exercise.js** runs a never-ending stress test putting messages on the worker queue through the producers HTTP endpoint.
The worker queue is durable and the messages persistent. The workers waits 400 milliseconds before sending ACK to simulate being busy doing stuff and will only accept one message at a time.

#### Play with
* The number of messages generated by exercise.js
* The number of workers, see **docker-compose.yml** (how many workers does it take to keep up with exercise.js?)
* The time a worker waits before sending an ACK  

*both ./producer and ./worker are running through nodemon and will reload inside the containers when you save any changes*
